To install, please follow these [instructions](https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/SIM/Catalogs+and+MAF).

If you want to use the git repo version of MAF together with a standard LSST stack 
(to get the newest MAF features together with all MAF dependencies), please see 
the instructions at the bottom of that [page](https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/SIM/Catalogs+and+MAF)
in the section "Mixing Installed Stack with Development Repositories".


If you use MAF, please cite [Jones et al, 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9149E..0BJ/abstract).
