Recommendation for install:
---------------------------
If you are installing on a Mac, we recommend using one of the common Python package managers.  It is important to build all the MAF dependencies consistently so there are not conflicts between compilers and linked libraries.

Example installing Python requirements with Anaconda (recommended?):
-----------------------
1) Install the anaconda package.  Anaconda includes numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sqlalchemy, and pyfits (via astropy).  Anaconda is available from:  https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/

2) Set your path to ensure the anaconda tools are first in your path.  For example, add the following line to your .bashrc file:
PATH=~/anaconda/bin:PATH

3) Check that you have the anaconda install tools first in your path:
>which easy_install
/Users/<you>/anaconda/bin/easy_install

4) Use easy_install to get healpy:
>easy_install healpy

5) (optional) install pyslalib from source



Example installing Python requirements with macports:
-----------------------
1) Install macports from:  http://www.macports.org/install.php

2) Use macports to install python and python packages:
>sudo port install python27
>sudo port install py-matplotlib
>sudo port install py27-pyfits 
>sudo port install XXX

Known Issues:
-------------
Healpy can fail to install if there is an old version of Xcode present. 
The latest version of Xcode does not need the /Developer directory, so try 
moving that and installing again.  Also in Xcode, go to 
Xcode->preferences->Downloads and get the latest Command Line Tools
